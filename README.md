BuGS
=======

BuGS is an implementation of an arcade classic for the Apple //gs.  You play the game using the mouse, moving your player to avoid the bugs and shoot them before they get you.  If you have an ADB trackball, the game play is even better.  The game supports stereo cards and when present, bugs travelling across the screen right to left will have their sound pan right to left matching their movement.

This game runs at 60 frames per second on a standard Apple //gs without an accelerator.  It also works in some Apple //gs emulators.  The [MAME emulator](https://www.mamedev.org) is recommended because it works best however it is difficult to setup.  [Kelvin Sherlock's Ample](https://github.com/ksherlock/ample) is suggested for MacOS users looking for a simpler way to setup MAME.  The [KEGS emulator](http://kegs.sourceforge.net) also works well as of v1.05.  Please see the readme shipped in the distribution for more details about emulators, which work well with BuGS and which do not.
