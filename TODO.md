* When a centipede segment is added on the right, if there is a mushroom either right at the edge or maybe on tile from the edge (not sure which), the segment seems to turn around and travel up along the edge of the screen.  Not sure if this can happen on the left side also.  This is likely a problem with the mushroom collision detection and a segment which is mostly off-screen should probably ignore blocking mushrooms until on-screen.
