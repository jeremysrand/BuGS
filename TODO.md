TODO
=======

* Look at supporting a global high score list for systems with an Internet connection
* Look at supporting System 5 which may allow a single disk bootable image.  System 6 is probably too big to ever fit on a 800k floppy with the game.
    * I tested it and BuGS crashes on launch if run from System 5.0.4.  Something is assuming System 6 or better.
    * Get the old boot disks from https://ftp.apple.asimov.net/images/gs/os/gsos/
* More ideas?
